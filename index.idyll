## What is the Oxford Cambridge Arc?

The Oxford Cambridge Arc in a region in south central England that runs between Oxford and Cambridge via Milton Keynes and four major settlements including Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. It is home to 3.7 million people, generating over 2 million jobs and contributing over Â£110 billion of annual Gross Value Added (GVA) to the UK economy per year. The area also contains some of the fastest growing and most productive towns and cities in the UK.

## Future Development Scenarios

A report published in 2018 by the National Infrastructure Commission outlined substantial plans to increase access and connectivity to the Arc area by 2050. This vision includes one million new homes across the Arc, an east-west Expressway road, and major improvements to rail routes. However, in order to learn more about how this vision would actually impact urban development, the [link text:"Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium (ITRC)" url:"https://www.itrc.org.uk/" /] team simulated possible futures of the Arc through computer modelling. This article will outline the steps of the analysis in more detail. To get started, the team first defined four high-level future scenarios based on the vision by making assumptions about the number of new homes and transport that will need to be build, where they will be built, and constraints on how much development can take place. The four scenarios are compared to a baseline representing the preesent day.

### Overview of Scenarios
1. Existing Expansion (Grey Policy)
2. Existing Expansion (Green Policy)
3. New Settlements (Grey Policy)
4. New Settlements (Green Policy)

[img src: `"static/images/" + "scenario" + "_" + dwlPolScenario + ".png"`/]

[h3 className:"imageCaption"]
  [Conditional if:`dwlPolScenario === "baseline"`]
    The baseline assumes that population will be based on recent growth rates and housing on recent average dwelling completion rates. There will be no new expressway or East West Rail.
  [/Conditional]

  [Conditional if:`dwlPolScenario === "grey_exp"`]
    The expansion grey scenario envisions that existing cities will expand due to inward migration. Good intra-city transport systems will be built with both the Express Way and the East West rail link developed.
  [/Conditional]

  [Conditional if:`dwlPolScenario === "grey_set"`]
    The new settlments scenario envisions new cities emerging. However, housing will be concentrated around existing cities with major growth in five new urban conurbations (clusters of smaller cities). Both the Express Way and the East West rail link will be developed.
  [/Conditional]

  [Conditional if:`dwlPolScenario === "green_exp"`]
    In the expansion scenario, existing cities will expand with high levels of population growth expected due to inward migration. Major growth will happen around existing urban centres with new dwellings divided among the major conurbations. Extensive new developments will occur on brown and greenbelt land, along with ongoing renovation/redevelopment of existing building stock. Good intra-city transport systems will be built with both the Express Way and the East West rail link developed. Despite development, there will be lower air pollution compared to the unplanned scenario due to adoption of EVs, public transport and decrease in private transport use, but high congestion.
  [/Conditional]

  [Conditional if:`dwlPolScenario === "green_set"`]
    In the new settlments scenario, new cities will emerge. As a result, population will increase due to inward migration. Housing will be concentrated around existing cities with major growth in five new urban conurbations (clusters of smaller cities). Smaller, more efficient homes, optimal density. Both the Express Way and the East West rail link will be developed but compared to the unplanned scenario there will be lower air pollution due to decrease in private transport use, less congestion, and increase in active transport.
  [/Conditional]

## The Urban Modelling Process

Using the future scenarios as a starting point, we can start to test out the theories and assumptions made through computer-based simulations. While we can't fully capture every nuance about the future built environment, analyzing and visualising the trade-offs can help planners and policy-makers make informed decisions. One of the modals used to assess the Arc is called the Urban Development Model (UDM). We will take a brief moment to explain the general process of the UDM before showing the results applied to the Arc.

### Overview of UDM Process Steps

1. Identify elements of the environment
2. Calculate current dwelling densities
3. Calculate ecosystem services
4. Identify constraints
5. Introduce future built environment features
6. Calculate attractiveness scores
7. Identify development suitability
8. Identify future dwelling density
9. Allocate future development
10. Calculate land use metrics

    Layer on plans for new development where there is a location in place to test assumptions (i.e., new rail stations, road nodes, settlement centres). Exclude individual homes because we do not yet know where they will be distributed.
  [/Conditional]

  [Conditional if:`processStep === 5`]
    Identify the areas best suitable for living by defining factors that will attract people to move to the Arc (i.e. proximity to employment or green space) and assigning each a 'weight'.
  [/Conditional]

  [Conditional if:`processStep === 6`]
    Combine the attractors and constraints to assess whether a an area of land is suitable for development, and which to prioritize. This measure of suitability considers the weight of each attractor in step 6, and blocks off cells with constraints in step 4.
  [/Conditional]

  [Conditional if:`processStep === 7`]
    Figure out how much development can actually take place by assigning options based on how many people can "fit" into undeveloped land based on proximity to urban centers or public transport. This often results in hotspots around town centers and business districts with high density.
  [/Conditional]

    Apply the urban development model to allocate future development at the identified densities (the most suitable areas first) to get a prediction of where development will actually take place.

## Applying Urban Modelling to the Arc Scenarios

Now that we have an understanding of the urban modelling process, let's look at how it was applied to the Arc. We will go through the process one step at a
time. For each step we will compare results at three different scales (Arc, city, neighbourhood) in order to compare both the bigger picture and details.

[var name:"selectedZoom" value: "arc" /]
[var name:"polScenario" value: "green" /]
[var name:"dwlScenario" value: "set" /]
[var name:"bldScenario" value: "23k" /]


### Step 1: Current built and natural environment

Existing urban land features (in blue) and non-urban land features (in green).


### Step 2: Current dwelling densities

Areas with more dwellings will have a higher density. This is represented by the blue cells, where the darker blue represents a higher density; the lighter blue the lower density.


[h3 className: "stepHeader"]
Step 3: Ecosystem services in the Arc
[/h3]

[h4 className:"selectLabel"]Change Scale[/h4]
[div className: "labeledSelect"]

    {value: "arc", label: "Arc"}
  ]`
  className: "customSelect"
/]
[/div]

[img src: `"./static/images/natcap_" + selectedZoom + ".png"` /]

Aspects of natural capital in the Arc include parks, grasslands, woodlands, verges, and any other aspect of green space, land uses, and habitats. The darker green represents higher quality ecosystem services.

[h3 className: "stepHeader"]
Step 4: Identify constraints
[/h3]

[var name:"selectedConstraints" value:"battlefields" /]
[div className: "labeledSelect"]
[h4 className:"selectLabel"]Select Constraint[/h4]
[Select value: selectedConstraints
  options:`[
    {value: "naturereserves", label: "Nature Recovery Networks"},

    {value: "scientificinterest", label: "SSSI"},
    {value: "heritagesites", label: "World Heritage Sites"},
    {value: "developedareas", label: "Currently developed areas"},
    {value: "waterbodies", label: "Water bodies	"}
  ]`

  ]`
  className: "customSelect"
/]
[/div]

[img src: `"./static/images/Step4/constraint_" + selectedZoom + "_" + selectedConstraints + ".png"` /]

We introduce constraints to protect nature, wildlife, historical landmarks, and areas which are not feasible to develop. We "block off" these areas from development.

  ]`
  className: "customSelect"
/]
[/div]

[ArcFuture selectedFutureTransport:selectedFutureTransport /]

Improvements to the transport links between Oxford and Cambridge are a key aspect of the future vision for the Arc. Future plans include a new expressway and East West Rail (EWR) will link Oxford and Cambridge. While the baseline scenario would not see any changes, the other scenarios would have rail stations and road nodes. New settlements would also include new settlement centres.


[h3 className: "stepHeader"]
Step 6. Calculate attractiveness scores
[/h3]

    {value: "roads", label: "Proximity to existing roads"},
    {value: "currentdevelopment", label: "Proximity to current development"},
    {value: "employment", label: "Accessibility to employment"},
    {value: "developedland", label: "Previously developed land"}
  ]`
  className: "customSelect"

[/div]

[h4 className:"selectLabel"]Change Scale[/h4]

    {value: "cty", label: "City"},
    {value: "arc", label: "Arc"}
  ]`
  className: "customSelect"
/]
[/div]

[img src: `"./static/images/Step6/attractiveness_" + selectedZoom + "_" + selectedAttractors + ".png"` /]

Attractors are things that will drive more people in to the Arc. Such attractors could include information on the performance of local schools, local accessibility (distance) to shops, services or transport hubs.

Step 7. Suitability of land for development
[/h3]

[h4 className:"selectLabel"]Select Policy Scenario[/h4]

  ]`
  className: "customSelect"
/]
[/div]

[img src: `"./static/images/suitability_" + polScenario + "_" + dwlScenario + "_" + selectedZoom + ".png"`  /]

Based on the weighing of both the attractors and contraints, the output of the UDM is a combined set of development suitability scores based on selected spatial scenarios and the combination of attractors and constraints defined. Each set of scores can then be represented as colours and displayed on a map to show the changing patterns of land from a birds-eye-view lens.

What's the required population density for new development? (in people per hectare) This assessment determines the levels of population migration to and within the Arc, given the relative attractiveness of different locations. We will focus on one planning scenario. Then step 9, we just look at the small bit
of suitable area. Follow same pattern as attractors and constraints. Might just be two scenarios. Maybe a different colour.

Step 10. Land use metrics

The final map shows the summary level selects (as opposed to grid level). Data based on the boundaries people care about like LAD. Here you can get some numbers about 9.


## Conclusion

This work has been carried out by researchers at the University of Oxford and Newcastle University in the UK, funded by the Alan Turing Institute (ATI), to inform the analysis, planning and design of resilient national, regional and local infrastructure across the world.
